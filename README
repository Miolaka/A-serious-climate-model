* repwvl V4.01 -- use representative wavelengths instead of full line-by-line spectrum
  (Master Thesis Sophie Meier, Bachelor Thesis Michael de Mourgues)

* void read_tau (...) returns an array of wavelengths, optical thicknesses and weights;
  integrated thermal radiance L is calculated as
  L = sum ( weight[iv] * radiance ( B(wvl[iv]), tau[iv][ilyr] ) )
  Note that planck radiances B must be given in W / (m2 nm sterad)!

* wavelengths wvl[nm], pressure [Pa], mixing ratio in absolute units (0.0004 instead of 400 ppm)

* all quantities (except pLev) are either level quantities (if prop_at_lev is 1) 
  or layer quantities (if prop_at_lev is 0); pLev is always a level quantity

* compile compile.sh example which only integrates Planck function at the surface
